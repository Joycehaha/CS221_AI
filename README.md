CS221 [ [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CWyxTrqLJs&list=PLVulhINWRk9GBHV61MTf1ZzaFCcgkszMK) ] in Youtube, lists the video lectures of CS221 Autumn 2018-19. Having Access to the video lectures is great. Since I didn't pay for the course, The only difference is , you don't get to ask TA's, submit the projects, but, you get access to notes and slides from the course website, get to learn CS221 ( & that's what matters the most). Also, I was lucky to have access to  CS221 Piazza class (CS221 doubt clearing channel) as I had access to my stanford email account. All in all, if you want to learn, stay truthful, learn the content well, be curious and Maintain Honor Code.

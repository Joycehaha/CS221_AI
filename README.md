CS221 [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CWyxTrqLJs&list=PLVulhINWRk9GBHV61MTf1ZzaFCcgkszMK) in Youtube holds the video lectures of Autumn 2018-19. Getting the video lectures is like attending the classes in person, as an SCPD student. The only difference is , you don't get to ask TA's, submit the projects, but, you get access to notes and slides.

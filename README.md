CS221 [ [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CWyxTrqLJs&list=PLVulhINWRk9GBHV61MTf1ZzaFCcgkszMK) ] in Youtube, lists the video lectures of CS221 Autumn 2018-19. Having Access to the video lectures is like attending the classes in person, as an SCPD student. The only difference is , you don't get to ask TA's, submit the projects, but, you get access to notes and slides from the course website. Also, I was lucky to have access to Piazza (CS221 doubt clearing channel) as I ghad access to my stanford email account.
